# h5bench: a Parallel I/O Benchmark Suite for HDF5

H5bench is a suite of parallel I/O benchmarks or kernels representing I/O patterns that are commonly used in HDF5 applications on high performance computing systems. H5bench measures I/O performance from various aspects, including the I/O overhead, observed I/O rate, etc.

You can access the full documentation and examples at [h5bench.readthedocs.io](https://h5bench.readthedocs.io)
