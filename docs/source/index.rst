h5bench
===================================

h5bench is a suite of parallel I/O benchmarks or kernels representing I/O patterns that are commonly used in HDF5 applications on high performance computing systems. H5bench measures I/O performance from various aspects, including the I/O overhead, observed I/O rate, etc. You can check h5bench's source-code at https://github.com/hpc-io/h5bench. You can check h5bench contiguous performance regression experiments in the Perlmutter supercomputer (NERSC) at https://bit.ly/NERSC-h5bench.
