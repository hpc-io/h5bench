Build Instructions
===================================

-----------------------------------
Build with CMake (recommended)
-----------------------------------

First, clone the h5bench GitHub repository and ensure you are cloning the submodules:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hpc-io/h5bench

If you are updating your h5bench, ensure you have the latest submodules that could be included in new releases:

.. code-block:: bash

    git submodule update --init

Dependency and environment variable settings
---------------------------------------------------

H5bench depends on MPI and parallel HDF5.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use system provided by HDF5 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For instance, on the Perlmutter system at NERSC:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    module load cray-hdf5-parallel

You can also load any parallel HDF5 provided on your system, and you are good to go.

.. warning::

    If you are using ``brew install hdf5-mpi`` in MacOS to install HDF5 with parallel support, make sure you export the installation path so h5bench can correctly detect the dependency:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export HDF5_HOME="$(brew --prefix hdf5-mpi)"

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use your own installed HDF5
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Make sure to unload any system-provided HDF5 version, and set an environment variable to specify the HDF5 install path:

.. code-block:: bash

    export HDF5_HOME=/path/to/your/hdf5/installation

It should point to a path that contains the ``include/``, ``lib/``, and ``bin/`` subdirectories.

If you want to build your own HDF5, use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5.git
    cd hdf5
    git checkout hdf5-1_14_1-2
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HDF5_HOME \ 
          -DHDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL=ON \
          -DHDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE=ON \ 
          -DALLOW_UNSUPPORTED=ON \
          -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc ..
    make -j && make install

.. warning::

    This snippet assumed you had already defined the ``HDF5_HOME`` environment variable to the location where you want HDF5 to be installed. Furthermore, it assumes you have ``mpicc`` available in your path. Notice that in some machines (e.g., Perlmutter), you might want to use ``cc` instead.

Compile with CMake
---------------------------------------------------

In the source directory of your cloned h5bench repository, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build

    cmake ..

    make
    make install

.. warning::

    If you plan on calling ``make install`` please notice that the default behavior of CMake is to install it system-wide. You can change the destination installation folder by passing the ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`` to override with your defined installation directory.    

By default, h5bench will only compile the base write and read benchmarks. To enable the additional benchmarks, you need to explicitly enable them before building h5bench. You can also enable all the benchmarks with ``-DH5BENCH_ALL=ON``. Notice that some of them have additional dependencies.

==================== =========================== ===============================
**Benchmark**        **Name**                    **Build**                     
==================== =========================== ===============================
h5bench write        ``h5bench_write``           Always   
h5bench read         ``h5bench_read``            Always   
Metadata Stress      ``h5bench_hdf5_iotest``     ``-DH5BENCH_METADATA=ON``
AMReX                ``h5bench_amrex``           ``-DH5BENCH_AMREX=ON``   
Exerciser            ``h5bench_exerciser``       ``-DH5BENCH_EXERCISER=ON``
OpenPMD (write)      ``h5bench_openpmd_write``   ``-DH5BENCH_OPENPMD=ON``
OpenPMD (read)       ``h5bench_openpmd_read``    ``-DH5BENCH_OPENPMD=ON``
E3SM-IO              ``h5bench_e3sm``            ``-DH5BENCH_E3SM=ON`` 
MACSio               ``h5bench_macsio``          ``-DH5BENCH_MACSIO=ON``
DLIO                 ``h5bench_dlio``            ``-DH5BENCH_DLIO=ON``
==================== =========================== ===============================

.. warning::

    If you want to specify the installation directory, you can pass ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to ``cmake``. If you are not installing it, make sure when you run ``h5bench``, you update your environment variables to include the `build` directory. Otherwise, h5bench will not be able to find all the benchmarks.

Build with HDF5 ASYNC VOL connector support
---------------------------------------------------

To run ``_async`` benchmarks, you need the develop branch of **both** HDF5 and ASYNC-VOL. When building h5bench you need to specify the ``-DWITH_ASYNC_VOL:BOOL=ON`` option and have already compiled the VOL connector in the ``$ASYNC_VOL`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build

    cmake .. -DWITH_ASYNC_VOL=ON -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-I/$ASYNC_VOL/src -L/$ASYNC_VOL/src"

    make
    make install

h5bench will automatically set the environment variables required to run the asynchronous versions, as long as you specify them in your JSON configuration file. However, if you run the benchmarks manually, you will need to set the following environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    export HDF5_HOME="$YOUR_HDF5_DEVELOP_BRANCH_BUILD/hdf5"
    export ASYNC_HOME="$YOUR_ASYNC_VOL/src"

    export HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR="async under_vol=0;under_info={}"
    export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH="$ASYNC_HOME"

    # Linux
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HDF5_HOME/lib:$ASYNC_HOME"
    # MacOS
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HDF5_HOME/lib:$ASYNC_HOME"

-----------------------------------
Build with Spack
-----------------------------------

You can also use Spack to install h5bench:

.. code-block:: bash

    spack install h5bench

There are some variants available as described bellow:

.. code-block:: bash
